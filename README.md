Reply Functionality: Allows businesses to reply to reviews directly from the platform.
Pagination: Handles multiple reviews efficiently.
User Authentication: Secures access using Auth0.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js - For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
Backend: Flask - Handles API requests and database interactions.
Database: SQLAlchemy - ORM for managing database operations.
APIs:
Google My Business API - For fetching reviews.
Auth0 - For secure user authentication and API access.
Version Control: Git - For tracking code changes and collaboration.
System Architecture
The platform consists of:

Frontend: Manages the user interface and communicates with the backend via API calls.
Backend: Processes requests, interacts with the database, and handles API integrations.
